# About
Hi, I'm Shuchang Wen.
I’m a Master of Engineering student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, with a strong foundation in computer science and practical experience across backend systems, NLP, and cloud infrastructure. 


My recent work includes building a scalable NLP pipeline for arXiv that resolves institutional affiliations using hybrid LLM workflows (spaCy, LangChain, Gemini API), boosting accuracy from 61% to over 94%.

Previously, I developed high-concurrency e-commerce systems, distributed monitoring tools in C++, and a medical imaging platform using deep learning. I enjoy solving real-world problems by combining robust engineering with machine learning.
