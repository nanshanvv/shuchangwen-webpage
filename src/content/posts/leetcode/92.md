# Leetcode 92: Reverse Linked List II

## 🧠 Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

- **Example Input**:

  ```python
  head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
  ```

- **Output**:

  ```python
  [1,4,3,2,5]
  ```

## 🔧 Solution Idea: Head Insertion Method

### ✅ Steps:

1. Create a dummy node `dummy` to simplify edge cases (like reversing from the head).
2. Move `pre` to the node right before position `left`.
3. Set `curr = pre.next` to point to the start of the sublist to be reversed.
4. **Perform `right - left` head insertions**, where each node after `curr` is inserted right after `pre`.

## 🔁 Core Loop Explanation

```python
curr = pre.next
for _ in range(right - left):
    temp = curr.next         # ① Get the node after curr
    curr.next = temp.next    # ② Detach temp from its current position
    temp.next = pre.next     # ③ Point temp to the front of the reversed part
    pre.next = temp          # ④ Insert temp after pre
```

### ✅ Example of Insertion:

Initial list: `1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5`, reverse positions 2~4  
After operations: `1 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 5`

## 📌 Head Insertion Technique Summary

The **head insertion method** is a common linked list technique especially useful for **partial reversals**. The core idea is:

> "Take the next node after `curr` and insert it right after `pre`, repeatedly."

### 🎯 Typical Use Cases:

- Reversing a sublist
- Insertion sort on linked list

## ✅ Full Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        pre = dummy

        for _ in range(left - 1):
            pre = pre.next

        curr = pre.next
        for _ in range(right - left):
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = temp.next
            temp.next = pre.next
            pre.next = temp

        return dummy.next
```

## 🔚 Summary

This problem demonstrates the powerful "head insertion" technique for in-place linked list reversal within a specified range. It is a classic and elegant approach to mastering linked list manipulation.
