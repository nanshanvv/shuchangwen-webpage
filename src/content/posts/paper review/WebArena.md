## 🧠 Background & Motivation

Current language agents are mostly tested in **simplified web or virtual environments**, which limits their generalization to real-world tasks. WebArena aims to provide:

- A **high-fidelity** web environment
- A **reproducible** testing platform
- **Functional evaluation**, focusing on whether tasks are actually accomplished rather than superficial action matching

---

## 🌐 Environment Design

### Types of Websites

- **E-commerce** (OneStopShop): simulates online shopping
- **Forum** (Reddit-like): supports posts, comments, and upvotes
- **Collaborative Development** (GitLab-like): for managing code repos and merge requests
- **Content Management System (CMS)**: for editing and publishing content

### Tools and Knowledge Resources

- Map
- Calculator
- Scratchpad
- Offline Wikipedia and user manuals

### Technical Implementation

- Each site is deployed in Docker for reproducibility
- Observations support multiple formats: DOM tree, accessibility tree, screenshots
- Action space includes clicking, typing, switching tabs, and URL navigation

---

## 📊 Benchmark Task Suite

- **812 natural language tasks** derived from 241 templates
- Task types:
  - Information Seeking
  - Site Navigation
  - Content & Configuration
- All tasks require multi-step, multi-page interactions

---

## ✅ Evaluation Method

### For Info-Seeking Tasks

- `Exact Match`
- `Must Include`
- `Fuzzy Match` (uses GPT-4 to judge semantic equivalence)

### For Interaction/Configuration Tasks

- Programmatically check the page state or backend DB
- Ensure actions produce the desired functional result

---

## 🤖 Baseline Results

Several LLM agents were evaluated using:

- Direct action prediction
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
- Whether to use "Unachievable Hint" (UA Hint)

| Model          | CoT  | UA Hint | Success Rate (%) |
| -------------- | ---- | ------- | ---------------- |
| GPT-4          | ✅    | ✗       | **14.41**        |
| GPT-3.5        | ✅    | ✅       | 8.75             |
| Text-Bison-001 | ✅    | ✅       | 5.05             |
| Human          | -    | -       | **78.24**        |

---

## 🔍 Error Analysis

- Models often incorrectly decide tasks are unachievable
- Lack recovery strategies after mistakes
- Poor generalization across similar task templates

---

## 🆚 Comparison with Existing Work

| Benchmark | Dynamic Interaction | Realistic Web | Diverse Human Tasks | Functional Evaluation |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| WebArena  | ✅                   | ✅             | ✅                   | ✅                     |
| Mind2Web  | ✗                   | ✅             | ✅                   | ✗                     |
| MiniWoB++ | ✅                   | ✗             | ✗                   | ✅                     |

## 📌 Conclusion

WebArena offers:

- A **realistic, multi-domain, multi-step web environment**
- End-to-end natural language to web interaction evaluation
- Results show: **Even GPT-4 struggles in realistic web tasks**

Future work should focus on:

- Enhancing exploration and recovery capabilities
- Improving task planning and memory
- Strengthening generalization across templates
